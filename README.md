README

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
	I've never had any experience with html or css so learning the basics was definitely frustrating at times. Especially formatting and running into little HTML/CSS "no-no's." Other than that, I think I picked up on it pretty quick and correctly implemented most things. I did try to make the design responsive but when going from desktop to mobile, I couldnt figure out how to keep the font the same. I also may have unnecessary tags or div's that I could have condensed (but kept for ease of styling) 

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
	I discussed the assignment with Joshua Berl and he helped me on minor styling issues that I ran into. 

Approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment?
	I spent a lot of time learning html/css and styling so I spent around 8 hours on this project
