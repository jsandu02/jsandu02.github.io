	<div class="bio">
		<p> Hi, I'm Julie.</p>

		<p> I'm a foodie with an eye for design. A mountain dweller who works at a coffee shop. And a tech-y whose end goal in life is to open a farm-to-table restaurant. </p>

		<p> I'm a junior at Tufts University majoring in a make-your-own-major. It's called Innovation &amp; Design Thinking and is just a little mix of Computer Science, Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies, and Design. </p>
