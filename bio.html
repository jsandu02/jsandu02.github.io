	Hi, I'm Julie.</p>
	<p> I'm a foodie with an eye for design. A mountain dweller who works at a coffee shop. And a tech-y whose end goal in life is to open a farm-to-table restaurant. </p>


	<p> In simpler terms, I'm a junior at Tufts University majoring in my make-my-own major. Called Innovation & Design Thinking, it's a little mix of Computer Science, Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies, and Design.</p>
