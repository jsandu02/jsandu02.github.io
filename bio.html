<p>
	Hi, I'm Julie. I'm an avid foodie, designer, mountaineer, and barista...weird mix, right? By creating my own major in ELS, Computer Science, and Design at Tufts, I've gotten the chance to guide my own course of study and find the intersection of my interests. But at the end of the day, my goal in life is to open a restaurant.
